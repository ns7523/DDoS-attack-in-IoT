1. Importing the packages
2. Exploring the dataset 
	CIDDS IOT dataset
3. Data processing
	- pandas dataframe
	- Dropping unwanted column

4. Visualization using seaborn & matplotlib
5. Label Encoding using LabelEncoder
6. Splitting the data X and Y for Machine Learning
8. Building the model

	- Decision Tree
	- Logistic Regression
	- MLP
	- SVM
	- Random Forest
	- Stacking Classifier - RF + MLP with LightGBM
	- Voting CLassifier - RF + AB

9. Training and Building the model


Flask Framework
----------------

 
10. Flask Framework with Sqlite for signup and signin
11. Importing the packages
12. User gives input as Feature Values 
13. The given input is preprocessed for prediction
14. Trained model is used for prediction
15. Final outcome is displayed through frontend

Extension
----------

In the base paper the author mentioned to use different machine learning model for analysis the dataset and proposed model RF got 98% of accuracy,
As an extension we applied an ensemble method  combining the predictions of multiple individual models to produce a more robust and accurate final prediction.
However, we can further enhance the performance by exploring other ensemble techniques such as Voting Classifier and Stacking CLassifier got 99% and 100% of accuracy 
As an extension we can build the front end using the flask framework for user testing and with user authentication.
